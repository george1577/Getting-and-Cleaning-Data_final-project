This is a data collection of a group of 30 volunteers wihin an age bracket of 19-48 years to perform six different kind of 
activities, including WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING.

The data has been distributed into two diiferent sets: test and train.
At first we combine these two different sets into one set of data, creating a new variable "activity" in the new dataset 
to indicate those six different activitites.

The original dataset has variable name V1, V2, V3...etc., these are converted to informative variable names
by referencing features.txt file.
The test and train data set were cleaned up to leave only "mean" and "standard deviation" for each measurement
Combine subject, activity with test and train dataset to obtain full set of data(with extracted mean and standard
deviation variables)

The independent tidy dataset was created from the previous full dataset by using the reshaping package of R.
The final data frame was generated by using melt and dcast function to gain average of each variable for each activity and each subject
